# Combat Rejoin Feature

## Overview
Allows players to rejoin their active combat session after refreshing the browser or reconnecting. A modal appears prompting them to rejoin or abandon the match.

## User Flow

### Normal Scenario
1. **Player is in combat** → Gets disconnected/refreshes browser
2. **Player reconnects** → Modal appears: "Active Combat Detected"
3. **Player clicks "Rejoin Combat"** → Returns to combat scene, rejoins battle
4. **Combat continues** → Player marked as reconnected, abandon timer cancelled

### Decline Scenario
1. **Player is in combat** → Gets disconnected/refreshes browser
2. **Player reconnects** → Modal appears
3. **Player clicks "Decline (Abandon)"** → Confirms abandonment
4. **Combat abandoned** → Player leaves combat, stays in lobby

## Implementation Details

### Backend (`combatService.js`)

#### New Function: `getActiveCombatForPlayer(playerId)`
Returns active combat info if player has one:

```javascript
{
  combatInstanceId: string,
  combatType: 'pvp' | 'pve' | 'team_pvp' | 'team_pve',
  isMatchmaking: boolean,
  zone: { center, radius },
  zoneId: number,
  startTime: timestamp,
  participants: { players: [], enemies: [] },
  playerState: {
    health: number,
    maxHealth: number,
    power: number,
    maxPower: number
  }
}
```

Returns `null` if player has no active combat.

---

### Socket Handler (`combat.js`)

#### New Event: `combat:check-active`

**Client Request:**
```javascript
socket.emit('combat:check-active', (response) => {
  // Check response
});
```

**Server Response:**
```javascript
{
  ok: true,
  hasActiveCombat: boolean,
  combat: { /* combat info */ } | null
}
```

**When it's called:**
- Automatically on player reconnect (`auth:ok` event)
- Can be called manually if needed

---

### Frontend (`App.jsx` + `CombatRejoinModal.jsx`)

#### Component: CombatRejoinModal

**Props:**
- `combatInfo` - Active combat data from backend
- `onRejoin(combatInfo)` - Callback to rejoin combat
- `onDecline()` - Callback to decline/abandon

**Features:**
- Shows combat type, duration, player count
- Displays player's current health and power
- Warning about abandonment penalty
- Loading state while rejoining
- Confirmation dialog for decline

#### Modal Display Information
- **Combat Type:** PvP, PvE, Team, Matchmaking
- **Duration:** Time elapsed since combat started
- **Players:** Number of participants
- **Health:** Current/Max health
- **Power:** Current/Max power
- **Warning:** Abandonment consequences

#### Integration in App.jsx

**State added:**
```javascript
const [showCombatRejoin, setShowCombatRejoin] = useState(false);
const [activeCombatInfo, setActiveCombatInfo] = useState(null);
```

**Check on connect:**
```javascript
socket.on('auth:ok', () => {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Check for active combat
  socket.emit('combat:check-active', (response) => {
    if (response?.ok && response.hasActiveCombat) {
      setActiveCombatInfo(response.combat);
      setShowCombatRejoin(true);
    }
  });
});
```

**Rejoin handler:**
```javascript
const handleCombatRejoin = async (combatInfo) => {
  setInCombatMatch(true);
  setShowCombatRejoin(false);
  
  socket.emit('combat:join-matchmaking', 
    { combatInstanceId: combatInfo.combatInstanceId }, 
    (response) => {
      if (response?.ok) {
        window.__inCombat = true;
        // Update zone, restore position
      }
    }
  );
};
```

**Decline handler:**
```javascript
const handleCombatRejoinDecline = () => {
  socket.emit('combat:leave'); // Marks as abandoned
  setShowCombatRejoin(false);
  setActiveCombatInfo(null);
};
```

## UI/UX Design

### Modal Appearance
- **Background:** Dark overlay with blur effect
- **Modal:** Gradient card with rounded corners
- **Header:** Red gradient background with combat icon
- **Content:** Info cards showing combat details
- **Actions:** Two large buttons (Rejoin / Decline)
- **Footer:** Small warning text

### Button States
1. **Rejoin Button (Primary)**
   - Teal gradient background
   - Shows "⏳ Rejoining..." when loading
   - Disabled during rejoin process

2. **Decline Button (Secondary)**
   - Semi-transparent white background
   - Shows confirmation dialog
   - Disabled during rejoin process

### Colors
- Primary (Rejoin): `#4ecdc4` → `#44a08d` (teal gradient)
- Warning (Header): `#ff6b6b` → `#ee5a6f` (red gradient)
- Background: `#1a1a2e` → `#16213e` (dark blue gradient)
- Text: White with varying opacity

## Technical Details

### State Management
**Backend:**
- Combat state persists in memory (`combatInstances` Map)
- Player state persists in memory (`playerCombatState` Map)
- Survives player disconnections (15-second grace period)

**Frontend:**
- Modal state managed in App.jsx
- Combat info stored temporarily
- Cleared on decline or successful rejoin

### Error Handling
**Scenarios handled:**
1. Combat already ended → Modal won't show
2. Socket disconnected → Modal shows on reconnect
3. Rejoin fails → Modal closes, player stays in lobby
4. Combat instance not found → Error logged, modal closes

### Edge Cases
1. **Player refreshes during countdown** → Combat may have already started, modal shows current state
2. **Multiple tabs open** → Each tab checks independently, first to rejoin wins
3. **Combat ends while modal is open** → `combat:ended` event closes modal
4. **Player takes too long** → 15-second abandonment timer still running

---

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Happy Path
1. Player in combat → Refresh browser → Modal appears
2. Click "Rejoin Combat" → Returns to combat scene
3. Combat continues normally
4. Player marked as reconnected

### ✅ Decline Path
1. Player in combat → Refresh browser → Modal appears
2. Click "Decline" → Confirm dialog appears
3. Confirm → Combat abandoned, stay in lobby
4. Stats recorded as abandoned

### ✅ Timeout Path
1. Player in combat → Refresh browser → Modal appears
2. Wait 15+ seconds → Combat abandoned automatically
3. Modal still shows (player can see state)
4. Clicking rejoin would fail

### ✅ Combat Ends During Modal
1. Player in combat → Refresh browser → Modal appears
2. Other players finish combat → `combat:ended` event fires
3. Modal should close automatically (future enhancement)
4. Player returns to lobby

## Benefits

✅ Can return to combat within grace period
✅ Clear information about combat state
✅ Choice to abandon if needed
✅ Smooth rejoin experience

### Technical Benefits
✅ Reduces unintentional abandonments
✅ Leverages existing abandon system
✅ No additional database changes
✅ Works with existing socket infrastructure
✅ Clean separation of concerns

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Countdown Timer in Modal**
Show seconds remaining before auto-abandon
```javascript
const remaining = 15 - Math.floor((Date.now() - emptyStartTime) / 1000);
// Display: "Rejoin within 0:12"
```

### 2. **Auto-close Modal on Combat End**
Listen for `combat:ended` event and close modal
```javascript
socket.on('combat:ended', () => {
  if (showCombatRejoin) {
    setShowCombatRejoin(false);
  }
});
```

### 3. **Show Combat Preview**
Display mini-map or combat state snapshot
- Player positions
- Health bars of all players
- Combat zone visual

### 4. **Rejoin Notification for Other Players**
Broadcast to other players when someone rejoins
```javascript
socket.to(`combat:${combatInstanceId}`).emit('player:rejoined', {
  playerId,
  playerName
});
```

### 5. **Statistics Tracking**
Track rejoin success rate
- How often players rejoin vs decline
- Average time to rejoin
- Correlation with win/loss

---

## Configuration

### Grace Period (Backend)
```javascript
// In combatService.js - checkAbandonedCombat()
const ABANDON_TIMEOUT = 15000; // 15 seconds
```

Can be increased to give players more time to rejoin.

### Modal Timeout (Frontend)
Currently no timeout - modal stays until player decides.
Could add auto-decline after N minutes.

---

## Console Logs

### Backend
```
[combat] Player 2 has active combat: combat-xxx
[combat] Player 2 reconnected to combat combat-xxx (2 players active)
[combat] Combat combat-xxx abandon timer cancelled - player 2 reconnected
```

### Frontend
```
[app] 🔄 Active combat detected on reconnect: { combatInstanceId: "combat-xxx", ... }
[app] 🔄 Rejoining combat: combat-xxx
[app] ✅ Successfully rejoined combat
```

Or if declined:
```
[app] 🚫 Player declined to rejoin combat
```
