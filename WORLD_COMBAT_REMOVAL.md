# World Combat Removal Summary

## Overview
World/open-world combat has been removed from the game. Players can now only engage in combat through the **structured matchmaking system**. The world zones are now **peaceful exploration areas**.

## What Was Removed

### Frontend (App.jsx)
- ❌ Removed `GameplayScene` component import and usage
- ❌ Removed scene state management (`currentScene: 'lobby' | 'battle'`)
- ❌ Removed `combat:ended` handler that switched back to lobby after world combat
- ❌ Removed combat-related keyboard bindings (attack, magic1-4 keys)
- ❌ Removed `handleHeroStatsUpdate` callback (was only for world combat stats)
- ❌ Simplified to single scene: LobbyScene only

### Backend (combat.js)
- ❌ Removed `combat:join` socket handler (manual world combat entry)
- ❌ Removed global combat instance for world PvP testing
- ❌ Removed `initializeCombatInstance` and `initializePlayerCombatState` imports (matchmaking handles initialization)
- ❌ Removed `enterCombat` import (matchmaking handles combat state)
- ❌ Updated documentation to clarify matchmaking-only usage

## What Was Kept

### Frontend
- ✅ **LobbyScene** - Peaceful exploration of all zones
- ✅ **Matchmaking system** - Queue for structured PvP battles (⚔️ Find Match button)
- ✅ **Zone system** - Travel between different zones via portals or zone selector
- ✅ **Hero selection** - Choose and manage heroes
- ✅ **Movement controls** - WASD/Arrows, jump, run still work
- ✅ **Chat system** - Communicate with other players
- ✅ **Ground.jsx** - Already has `disableCombat` flag properly implemented

### Backend
- ✅ **Combat service** - Core combat logic (used by matchmaking)
- ✅ **Combat tick system** - Processes matchmaking battles
- ✅ **Spell casting system** - Works in matchmaking battles
- ✅ **Combat history** - Tracks matchmaking battle results
- ✅ **Combat position updates** - Player movement during matchmaking battles
- ✅ **Zone combat tracking** - Zones track active matchmaking battles
- ✅ **New handler**: `combat:join-matchmaking` - Allows players to join matchmaking-created combat instances

## Game Flow Now

1. **Login** → Select Hero
2. **Explore** → Peaceful zones with other players (LobbyScene)
3. **Matchmaking** → Click "⚔️ Find Match" or press 'P'
4. **Combat** → Structured PvP battles in arena zones
5. **Return** → Back to peaceful exploration after match ends

## Matchmaking Combat Flow

### Frontend Flow
1. Player clicks "⚔️ Find Match" button
2. `MatchmakingQueue` component opens, player selects queue type
3. Player joins queue via `matchmaking:join` 
4. Wait for `match:found` event (shows countdown)
5. Receive `match:started` event with `combatInstanceId`, `zone`, `position`
6. **App.jsx** calls `combat:join-matchmaking` with `combatInstanceId`
7. **LobbyScene** receives `combat:joined` event, sets `inCombat = true`
8. Combat is now enabled (Ground component allows spell casting)
9. Players fight in the arena zone
10. Receive `combat:ended` event when battle finishes
11. **LobbyScene** sets `inCombat = false`, disables combat
12. **App.jsx** returns player to lobby zone after 3 seconds
13. Combat complete - player can explore or queue again

### Backend Flow
1. Player joins queue via `matchmaking:join`
2. When enough players: `matchmakingService.checkAndStartMatch()`
3. Match countdown begins, emits `match:found` to all players
4. After countdown: `matchmakingService.startCombat()`
5. Creates combat instance via `combatService.initializeCombatInstance()` with `isMatchmaking: true`
6. Registers combat with `registerCombatInstance()` for tick processing
7. Teleports players to arena zone
8. Emits `match:started` to each player with combat details
9. Players join via `combat:join-matchmaking` handler
10. Combat tick system processes battle (spell casting, damage, healing)
11. When battle ends: `checkCombatConditions()` detects winner
12. `endCombatInstance()` updates player stats, saves combat history
13. Emits `combat:ended` with `isMatchmaking: true` to all players
14. Players are returned to lobby zone

## Architecture Benefits

### Cleaner Separation
- **Exploration**: Peaceful world exploration without combat interruption
- **Combat**: Structured, balanced PvP through matchmaking system

### Improved Player Experience
- No unexpected combat encounters
- Fair matchmaking-based PvP
- Clear distinction between exploration and combat
- Combat only happens in dedicated arena zones

### Technical Improvements
- Simpler state management (no scene switching)
- Single frontend scene (LobbyScene)
- Combat only initiated through controlled matchmaking flow
- Better control over combat instances

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` 
  - Removed GameplayScene import and usage
  - Removed scene state management
  - Added `match:started` handler to join matchmaking combat
  - Added `combat:ended` handler to return to lobby after matchmaking battles
  - Simplified to LobbyScene only

- `frontend/src/components/LobbyScene.jsx`
  - Added combat state tracking (`inCombat`)
  - Dynamically enables/disables combat based on matchmaking battles
  - Listens for `combat:joined` and `combat:ended` events
  - Ground component now uses `disableCombat={!inCombat}`

### Backend
- `backend-socket/sockets/combat.js` 
  - Removed `combat:join` handler (world combat entry)
  - Removed global combat instance tracking
  - Added `combat:join-matchmaking` handler for matchmaking battles
  - Updated documentation to clarify matchmaking-only usage

### Unchanged (Already Configured Correctly)
- `frontend/src/components/Ground.jsx` - Already respects `disableCombat` flag
- `backend-socket/services/combatService.js` - Core logic used by matchmaking
- `backend-socket/services/zoneService.js` - Zone tracking works for matchmaking
- `backend-socket/sockets/matchmaking.js` - Matchmaking system unchanged

## Migration Notes

### For Frontend Developers
- Only `LobbyScene` is now used for exploration
- Remove references to `GameplayScene` if creating new features
- Combat features should integrate with matchmaking system
- Use `disableCombat={true}` for any new exploration scenes

### For Backend Developers
- Use `combat:join-matchmaking` handler for matchmaking battles
- Do not use `combat:join` (removed)
- Combat instances should be created via `matchmakingService`
- Set `isMatchmaking: true` when creating combat instances

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Players can explore zones peacefully
- [ ] No combat initiation in exploration zones
- [ ] Matchmaking queue works (⚔️ Find Match button)
- [ ] Matchmaking battles start correctly
- [ ] Players can cast spells in matchmaking battles
- [ ] Combat ends properly and returns players to lobby
- [ ] Zone transitions work without combat interference
- [ ] Hero stats update correctly after matchmaking battles
- [ ] Combat history saves matchmaking battle results

## Future Considerations

### Potential Additions
- PvE matchmaking (dungeons, raids)
- Ranked matchmaking with leaderboards
- Team-based exploration zones (PvE co-op areas)
- Special event zones with temporary combat

### Not Recommended
- Re-adding world combat (goes against the peaceful exploration design)
- Auto-combat zones (forces unwanted combat on players)
